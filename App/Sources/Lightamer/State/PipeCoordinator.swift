/// **Display push (D-X1 invariant):** this coordinator is the ONLY writer
/// of `EditorState.displayTexture` — every path funnels through
/// `renderPreview` → `editorState?.displayTexture`. Views never trigger
/// renders; `drawableDidChange` is an INPUT event (geometry), not a render
/// producer.
///
/// **EditorState linkage (plan choice, documented):** the plan offered a
/// weak `EditorState` reference OR a display-push closure. Chosen: the weak
/// reference (`attach(editorState:)`), because both objects are strongly
/// owned by the app root (`@State`) — a single weak back-reference gives
/// the cycle-free graph with zero closure plumbing. Construction order
/// (coordinator needs the state instance; state needs the coordinator for
/// `load` delegation) also rules out true init-time injection.
///
/// **Render-path isolation:** coordinator methods are `@MainActor async`,
/// but the heavy work (CIRAW decode leg, bitmap render, kernel dispatch)
/// lives in nonisolated async Core code — the MainActor only awaits results
/// and mutates this state. A `generation` counter discards results from
/// superseded events (newest-wins without task bookkeeping).
///
/// **SEAMS (documented extension points, no code yet per plan):**
/// - **02-05 history:** `paramsDidChange()` internals are replaced by the
///   history stack's `effectiveInstances()` — the instance set here is
///   swapped wholesale on history navigation instead of mutating in place.
/// - **02-06 clearCaches (D-C1/D-C2):** `load(...)` fires
///   `cache.clearCaches(keeping:)` at its entry (KeepingPolicy consumes
///   `currentImageID` + `previousImageID`, both tracked here), plus a 60s
///   sweep task; the per-URL `imageIDMap` UUIDs persist into sidecars.
/// - **02-04 terminal trio / display profile:** a display-profile change
///   hooks in next to `drawableDidChange` and invalidates ONLY the terminal
///   segment (colorout/gamma) — upstream planes must survive it.
